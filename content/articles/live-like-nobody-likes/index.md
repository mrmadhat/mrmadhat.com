Often times when I'm thinking of writing a post, creating something or saying
something to someone I don't. Why? Because I start to think what I'm about to
put out into the world will cause someone I hardly know (or even someone I know
well) to think less of me/not like me. I think a lot of people who struggle with
anxiety have experienced this and it can really prevent you from doing something
good/positive/incredible. How can we get around this? Live like nobody likes
you.

## You are now free to say what you want

At first, this may seem like a crazy thought. Living life like everyone you know
or meet doesn't really like you is something that will surely make you feel more
anxious. But will it? If nobody likes you then anything you say/do from that
moment on is irrelevant. You don't need to try and impress Mr random person you
just met because they don't like you anyway! So when you want to say something
you can be free to say it, if it turns out you are wrong and that person does
like you then you've just said something that you would normally say ergo
increasing the positive relationship you already have with thatÂ person. Second
guessing yourself over a tweet because you think that someone will think you're
an idiot? Well if they already think you're an idiot does it really matter? NO!
Tweet away happily ðŸ˜œ

### Endless possibilities

I think the possibilities with adopting this mindset are endless. You're no
longer bound by what someone else will think because you're accepting the
possibility that they may already think the worst.

## Coming back to reality

The fact is, in reality, you're probably not a bad person and it's highly likely
that lots of people enjoy the things you say and the thoughts you share, it's
just you who's having a problem believing it. I'm just suggesting you adopt a
mindset that allows you to truly be yourself without fearing what others will
think. Use it as a tool to stop you from holding back who you really are.

## If it works for you it works if not try something else

This is something that I personally find helpful and the intention isn't to make
anybody feel worse about themselves. So if you try this and it makes things
worse then stop and try something else. Do what works for you and keep trying.
