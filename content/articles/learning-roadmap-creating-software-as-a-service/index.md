One of my main focuses for 2020 is to learn how to develop and release Software
as a Service (SaaS). This article outlines the process I'm going to take over
the course of the year to accomplish that goal. To start, I want to clarify
exactly what I mean when I say Software as a Service to narrow the scope of my
learning and ensure I remain focused on a single specific objective.

## My Definition of SaaS

My definition of Software as a Service is a web app--such as
[trello](https://trello.com/)\--whose business model is based on recurring
payment in exchange for access to some or all of the software. The software must
provide a service to the end user which is valuable, value is created by saving
the customer time, money or both. My focus will be to create standalone web apps
and as a result software the exists solely to extend other software, such as
WordPress plugins, are not included in my definition.

## What does success look like?

I will know that I have been successful when one or more of the following is
true:

1. I have a working piece of software that is publicly available
2. I have a working piece of software that is publicly available that can accept
   payment in exchange for access to some or all of the features
3. The software I create has a paying customer
4. The software I create has over 10 paying customers
5. The software I create has over 100 paying customers

Success is not all or nothing, it should be looked at as a scale of success.
Failure is also expected and welcomed throughout the learning process but
recovery should be quick and lessons should be learnt from the failure.

## Approach to learning

My approach to learning will involve understanding just enough theory to be able
to put what I want to learn into practice. I will constantly seek out the
quickest way to gain a **solid** understanding about a subject. For example, if
I want to learn about agile development I could spend hours reading a book about
agile or, I may find
[a website that explains the topic well](http://www.agilenutshell.com/), watch a
some videos and gain enough understanding so that I reach a point where I feel
confident enough to put what I've learnt into practice. After attempting what
I've learnt I expect one of three outcomes:

1. What I have learnt is sufficient enough to allow me to complete the task at
   hand efficiently
2. What I have learnt is sufficient but not efficient
3. What I have learnt is insufficient and means I cannot complete the task

I imagine item number one will be a rarity but welcomed non the less, items two
and three are more probable and in situations where one of them is the outcome I
will return to theory to better understand the task I'm trying to complete. I
hope this approach to learning will give me a quick feedback loop which will
allow me to move forward quickly and efficiently.

## Learning Guidelines

The list below is an initial outline of the items I feel I need to learn/get
better at to achieve the goals above, I expect this list to change and grow
throughout the year:

1. Development and deployment of robust software for the web

   - Agile software development Aspects of SaaS
   - Software Architecture
   - Languages and frameworks
   - Test Driven Development
   - Databases
   - Deployment
   - Tooling and Productivity

1. Business aspects

   - Validating a product
   - Identifying opportunities and value
   - Marketing the product/software

## Conclusion

The above is an attempt to gain clarity of thought and clearly specify what it
is that I want to achieve in the coming year. Although this article seems to
take a somewhat set in stone attitude towards my learning process it should be
noted that I expect the above to change throughout the year. This is merely the
first step in documenting what I want to achieve and is part of a larger plan to
document the overall 'story'. I know that there are many, many people out there
who are smarter and more experienced than I am in the area of software
development and I welcome your thoughts, feedback and criticism.
