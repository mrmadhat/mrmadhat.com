Something that I’ve realised about myself during the Corona virus pandemic is
that committing myself to something is much easier when there is a inescapable
deadline in place.

Last year I signed up for Iron Man UK which motivated me to research training
plans, pick one and most importantly stick to the plan. This lead me to train 6
days a week consistently, yes there was times where I would have a day off but
it was always followed by a fear that I wouldn’t be ready for race day which
promptly forced me back to training. The thought of not being ready for the race
got me out of the door more times than I could count, even if I couldn’t be
bothered.

I even signed up to a second (24 hour) gym so I didn’t have the excuse that it
was too late to train after procrastinating. Outside of training I was also
making great efforts to make sure I was fuelling my body correctly, preparing
all my food in advance once a week. The effect on my life really was profound.

Then the corona virus pandemic took hold on the world and as the situation
unfolded events I had planned leading up to the big race where postponed, gyms
where closed and supermarkets ran out of food. Despite Ironman not officially
announcing the postponement of the UK race, for me it’s not happening this year.
I had a limited amount of time (1 year) to prepare and everything had to run
like clockwork when everything fell to pieces I just didn’t--and still
don’t--have the confidence that I’ll be able to complete the race this year even
if it goes ahead.

Without having a fast approaching concrete deadline in place the incentive to
train, eat well and generally look after myself has quickly deteriorated which
is a real shame. It’s so much easier to say “I’ll do it tomorrow” when there
isn’t an immediate impact on your life/movement towards your goals. I’m not
going to give up training but I now need a lot more willpower to 'get out the
door and get it done' which I don’t have all the time.

The silver lining in all this is that I know a little bit more about myself and
how to make myself complete the things I want to complete, set an immutable
inescapable deadline. The deadline needs to be within a short timeframe in
relation to the work required to achieve it and there needs to be a strong
punishment when the deadline isn’t met. The result of me not training before
Covid-19 was the embarrassment of my family seeing me failing to complete the
race which was fire enough for me. In future I know to give myself a deadline
that forces me to complete what I set out to do or face the consequences.
