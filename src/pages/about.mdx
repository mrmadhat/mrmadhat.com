# Hi! I'm Danny ðŸ‘‹

I'm a website developer from Bolton UK. I studied Art and Design in college and
fell in love with programming. Currently, I work for a local marketing agency
creating building and maintaining websites. My main focus for many years has
been building WordPress websites for clients but I've always wanted to build
digital products. This website exists to document my journey of product
development and make the process of product development easier for others.
